Yo what's good, I'm Evan.

## ðŸ’¼ Professional Pathway

I have years in the trenches of tech support and operations, I've developed a pretty decent sense for solving intricate problems, ensuring systems not only run but flourish under my watch. My expertise spans across:

- **Incident Management & Troubleshooting:** Herding cats through burning buildings
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Making system health and oncall so easy your Grandma can do it
- **Container Orchestration & Automation:** I like hands off deployments and things that just work with minimal human intervention
- **Self-Hosting & Home Labs:** I like self-hosting because of the complete control and lack of surprise overage bills from your favorite cloud provider

## ðŸ›  Tech Toolbox

I navigate the Ops realm with a wide set of tools and technologies, from `Docker` and `Kubernetes` for container orchestration to `Ansible` and `Terraform` for infrastructure as code, all aimed at creating scalable, fault-tolerant systems.
