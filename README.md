Hello, I'm Evan, a dedicated Support Engineer and SRE/DevOps enthusiast with a rich history of navigating the complex landscapes of support engineering. My journey is marked by a relentless pursuit of excellence in troubleshooting, incident management, and monitoring, underpinned by a deep passion for self-hosting and home lab experimentation.

## 💼 Professional Pathway

With years in the trenches of tech support and operations, I've developed a keen sense for solving intricate problems, ensuring systems not only run but thrive under my watch. My expertise spans across:

- **Incident Management & Troubleshooting:** Mastering the art of calm in the digital storm. 
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Crafting transparent systems that speak volumes, leveraging tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki to keep a pulse on operations.
- **Container Orchestration & Automation:** Orchestrating containers with Docker Compose, fine-tuning services in my homelab like Plex, and ensuring seamless service delivery.
- **Self-Hosting & Home Labs:** Building and managing a personal cloud that mirrors the resilience and efficiency of enterprise-grade environments.

## 🛠 Tech Toolbox

I navigate the DevOps realm with a diverse set of tools and technologies, from `Docker` and `Kubernetes` for container orchestration to `Ansible` and `Terraform` for infrastructure as code, all aimed at creating scalable, fault-tolerant systems.

## 🌱 Continuous Growth

In a field that never sleeps, I'm committed to lifelong learning—constantly exploring new technologies, methodologies, and best practices to stay at the forefront of the SRE/DevOps sphere.
